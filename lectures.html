								Thomas Dimson was one of the first 40 employees at Instagram, back in 2013 when the app was still new. He is the original author of "the algorithm" at Instagram, and was the brain behind how feeds and stories work. He invented Hyperlapse, which is the app that was used for the filming of the music video for "Centuries" by Fall Out Boy. He also invented Instagram products such as stories polling sticker, and emogineering. In 2015 he was named one of the top 10 most creative people in business worldwide, and in 2018 he was promoted from Principal Engineer to Director of Engineering at Instagram.<br>						
								Dimson earned his MSc in CS from Stanford University, where he specialized in Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Data Mining. Prior to that he earned a triple-degree in Applied Math, Computer Science, and Pure Math at University of Waterloo, and worked at Amazon, Bloomberg L.P. and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.<br>							
								Dimson has over 30 US patents listed on Google Scholar as of January 2021, and several of his publications and patents have acquired an unusually high number of citations.
