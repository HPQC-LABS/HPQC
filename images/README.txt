# Procedure for cropping photos for people.html
================================================

If anything doesn't seem easy, or seems to look different from what's described below, please let an admin know:

1) https://www.img2go.com/crop-image (drag and drop your photo into the box)
2) Make the cropping window have dimensions: Width=270, Height=285 (you might have to zoom out to see the boxes where you can type custom values).
3) Drag the cropping window by a corner (rather than a side), to preserve the aspect ratio.
4) Include the full face and full hair, but ***not much neck or body***. It's like a passport photo, but smiles are allowed! See examples here (good examples are the photos of Greg, Justin, Henri, etc.; notice that there's not much space between the chin and the bottom of the picture, not much space between the head hair and the top of the picture, etc.): https://hpqc.org/people.html. Please make your picture exactly likek Greg's, in terms of the space between the chin and the bottom of the photo!
5) Click "Apply"
6) Click "Save As"
7) Set "Target Format" to "PNG"
8) Set "Filename" to be FirstnameLastName.PNG. If the original image was a PNG, then use JPG. This way the original image and the cropped image have the same name, and just a different extension
9) Don't forget to make sure "Quality" is set to 100%
10) Set "DPI" to 3000 (this presumably sets it to the maximum DPI, which seems to be 1200 at the time of writing this).
11) Click "Save"
12) Add the new saved (and cropped) photo to the images folder, but do not use the GitHub website to "upload" the photo: Instead using the "git commit" and "git push" commands to do this in a terminal. You can ask questions in the #git channel on the HPQC Discord group if you need help with that! Let your contact person know, if you need an invitation to the Discord group.
13) In your pull request, please provide a screenshot of your photo's dimensions, as shown here: https://i.stack.imgur.com/az3ke.png).
